# SQL Query Building

I created this tool just to explore & learn the basics of Angular 7. It also means, SQL Maker was my first project in Angular Framework.

This project runs along with WebApi written in C# (the actually the brain of the project that generates the SQL queries)
API Link: https://github.com/angry-coder-room/Query-Maker-Api

The project is capable of generating all kinds of JOIN operations with 2 tables only.
